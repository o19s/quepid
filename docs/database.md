# Database


## Restore a Database

Assuming you have used mysqldump to get a dump, you can restore to dev via:

```
mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 -u root -p quepid_development < quepid_prod_2021_03_02.sql
```

Or if you have a Zip file:

```
unzip -p quepid_prod_2021_03_02.sql.zip | mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 -u root -p quepid_development
```

## Emoji Support

Both the `scorers` and `queries` tables have columns that support using emojis.   To do this, they need
a different set of options when creating the tables:

```
CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_bin
```

If your migration add/drops a table, you may need to edit `schema.rb` to restore that definition.  Your tests
will fail fortunately ;-).  Expect to see `ERROR emoji support#test_handles_emoji_in_code (27.86s)`
