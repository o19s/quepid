## ClaudeOnRails Configuration

You are working on Quepid, a Rails application. Review the ClaudeOnRails context file at @.claude-on-rails/context.md

Use yarn instead of npm for package management.

Documentation goes in the `docs` directory, not a toplevel `doc` directory.

To understand the data model used by Quepid, consult `./docs/data_mapping.md`.

To understand how the application is built, consult `./docs/app_structure.md`.
