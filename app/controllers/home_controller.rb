  # If Quepid is running on HTTPS, like on Heroku, then it needs to switch
  # to HTTP in order to make calls to a Solr that is running in HTTP as well, otherwise
  # you get this "Mixed Content", which browsers block as a security issue.
  # https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content
  #
  # Similarily we may have only HTTPS set up for Quepid, and therefore need to stay on HTTPS,
  # so this method is only conditionally called if force_ssl is false.
  #
  # The skip_changing_to_matching_tls lets us override this behavior, which we have to do when
  # you edit the search engine url in the front end.  We need to change first, then come back
  # and ask the person to reapply the change.
