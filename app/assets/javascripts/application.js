// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
// or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file.
//
// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives.
//
// The long list of requires for the main Angular 1 application has been moved to core.js.
// 
// We have introduced importmaps, which live in application_modern.js.  These below items should probably be migrated
// over to that file assuming import maps works the way we are hoping!

//= require bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle
//= require jquery

// party-js moved to application_modern.js with importmaps

// CodeMirror imports moved to application_modern.js with importmaps for CodeMirror 6
