// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
// or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file.
//
// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives.
//
// This file loads all the below JavaScript files and can be very slow in the dev mode.
//
// Use the bootstrap-sprockets instead of bootstrap when you need individual boostrap files for
// debugging.  Otherwise the bootstrap version loads all the files as a single minified file.

//= require jquery
//= require rails-ujs

//= require cookies_eu
//= require bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle
//= require turbolinks
