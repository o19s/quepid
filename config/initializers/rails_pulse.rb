  #   - "experimental" (for routes under development)
  #   - "deprecated" (for routes being phased out)
  #   - "external" (for third-party API calls)
  #   - "background" (for async job-related operations)
  #   - "admin" (for administrative routes)

  # ====================================================================================================
  # When enabled, Rails Pulse captures unhandled exceptions raised during web
  # requests and failed background jobs, groups them by class and location, and
  # displays them in the Exceptions tab. Rake tasks are not captured automatically —
  # call ExceptionCaptureService.capture yourself if needed.
  #
  # Capture runs synchronously on the calling thread (upsert + insert). That keeps
  # the implementation simple for v1; under an error storm it adds DB latency to
  # failing requests and jobs. Set track_exceptions = false to disable.
  #
  # The gem default is false so existing installs do not start capturing on
  # upgrade. New apps get true from this template; the upgrade generator
  # inserts false into existing initializers.
  #
  # Backtraces store the first 50 frames. Request params are filtered via Rails'
  # filter_parameters. Exception messages are filtered too: the SQL and echoed
  # values in ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid messages are stripped, and any
  # `key=value` / `key: value` fragment whose key matches filter_parameters
  # (password=…, token: …) is masked. Messages are truncated to 500 characters.

  # Enable or disable exception tracking
  config.track_exceptions = true

  # Capture the raw (unparameterized) SQL for each operation.
  # WARNING: mysql2 defaults to prepared_statements: false, so every literal

  #                                            DATABASE CONFIGURATION
  # ====================================================================================================
  # Configure Rails Pulse to use a separate database for performance monitoring data.
  # This is optional but recommended for production applications to isolate performance
  # data from your main application database.
  #
  # Uncomment and configure one of the following patterns:

  # Option 1: Separate single database for Rails Pulse
  # config.connects_to = {
  #   database: { writing: :rails_pulse, reading: :rails_pulse }
  # }

  # Option 2: Primary/replica configuration for Rails Pulse
  # config.connects_to = {
  #   database: { writing: :rails_pulse_primary, reading: :rails_pulse_replica }
  # }

  # Don't forget to add the database configuration to config/database.yml:
  #
  # production:
  #   # ... your main database config ...
  #   rails_pulse:
  #     adapter: postgresql  # or mysql2, sqlite3
  #     database: myapp_rails_pulse_production
  #     username: rails_pulse_user
  #     password: <%= Rails.application.credentials.dig(:rails_pulse, :database_password) %>
  #     host: localhost
  #     pool: 5
  #     migrations_paths: db/rails_pulse_migrate
  #     schema_dump: false

  # ====================================================================================================
  #                                            AUTHENTICATION
  # ====================================================================================================
  # Configure authentication to secure access to the Rails Pulse dashboard.
  # Authentication is ENABLED BY DEFAULT outside development and test.
  #
  # If nothing below is configured, Rails Pulse will use HTTP Basic Auth
  # with credentials from RAILS_PULSE_USERNAME (default: 'admin') and RAILS_PULSE_PASSWORD
  # environment variables. Set RAILS_PULSE_PASSWORD to enable this fallback.

  # Enable/disable authentication (enabled by default outside development/test)
  # config.authentication_enabled = !Rails.env.local?

  # Where to redirect users when an authentication hook raises
  # config.authentication_redirect_path = "/"

  # RECOMMENDED: a fail-closed predicate. Receives the controller; return
  # true to allow. Anything else (false, nil, no user) is a 403 Forbidden.
  # config.authorize = ->(controller) { controller.current_user&.admin? }
  #
  # A zero-argument proc runs in the controller's context instead:
  # config.authorize = proc { user_signed_in? && current_user.admin? }

  # This repo already gates Blazer/MissionControl::Jobs behind AdminConstraint
  # at the router (see config/routes.rb) - this mirrors the same check here as
  # defense in depth, independent of how the engine is mounted.
  config.authorize = lambda { |controller|
    user_id = controller.session['current_user_id']
    user = user_id && User.find_by(id: user_id)
    user&.administrator? || false
  }

  # Alternatively, a hook that runs in the controller and DENIES BY RENDERING
  # OR REDIRECTING. Returning false without responding is also a denial;
  # returning nil (what `unless … end` returns on success) allows the request.
  # Do not write predicate-style checks here — use config.authorize for those.
  # If both are set, authentication_method runs first, then authorize.

  # Example 1: Devise with admin role check
  # config.authentication_method = proc {
  #   unless user_signed_in? && current_user.admin?
  #     redirect_to main_app.root_path, alert: "Access denied"
  #   end
  # }

  # Example 2: Custom session-based authentication
  # config.authentication_method = proc {
  #   unless session[:user_id] && User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])&.admin?
  #     redirect_to main_app.login_path, alert: "Please log in as an admin"
  #   end
  # }

  # Example 3: Warden authentication
  # config.authentication_method = proc {
  #   warden.authenticate!(:scope => :admin)
  # }

  # Example 4: Basic HTTP authentication
  # config.authentication_method = proc {
  #   authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic do |username, password|
  #     ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare(username, ENV['RAILS_PULSE_USERNAME']) &&
  #       ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare(password, ENV['RAILS_PULSE_PASSWORD'])
  #   end
  # }

  # Example 5: Custom authorization check
  # config.authentication_method = proc {
  #   current_user = User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])
  #   unless current_user&.can_access_rails_pulse?
  #     render plain: "Forbidden", status: :forbidden
  #   end
  # }

  # STANDALONE DASHBOARD (bundle exec rails_pulse_server; see railspulse.com/documentation/deployment-modes):
  # that process has your models but not your app's session, Warden or Devise
  # helpers, and runs on its own hostname, so the hooks above are ignored there.
  # By default it uses HTTP Basic auth (RAILS_PULSE_USERNAME / RAILS_PULSE_PASSWORD).
  # Set this to run something else instead; same rules as authentication_method
  # (deny by rendering or redirecting, or by returning false).
  # config.standalone_authentication_method = proc {
  #   authenticate_or_request_with_http_token do |token, _options|
  #     ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare(token, ENV["RAILS_PULSE_DASHBOARD_TOKEN"].to_s)

  # API token for the POST /rails_pulse/deployments endpoint.
  # When set, requests must include an `X-Rails-Pulse-Token` header matching this value.

  # Set this in your CI/CD pipeline and store the value in credentials or an environment variable:
  #   config.deployment_api_token = Rails.application.credentials.dig(:rails_pulse, :deployment_api_token)
  #   config.deployment_api_token = ENV["RAILS_PULSE_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN"]
  #
  # Limits: revision ≤ 255 characters, metadata ≤ 4 KB serialized, started_at at most
  # one hour in the future. Rows beyond max_table_records[:rails_pulse_deployments]
  # are pruned oldest-first by the cleanup task.
  #
  # Record a deployment from your CI/CD pipeline:
  #   curl -X POST https://yourapp.com/rails_pulse/deployments \

  #     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  #     -d '{"deployment": {"revision": "abc1234", "metadata": {"environment": "production"}}}'
  #
  # Or use the rake tasks for shell-based deploys (no token or HTTP access needed):
  #   rake rails_pulse:record_deployment[abc1234]
  #   rake rails_pulse:finish_deployment[abc1234]
  # Metadata for the rake task comes from an environment variable, as a JSON object:

  #                                       HISTORICAL COMPARISON
  # ====================================================================================================

  # Rails Pulse compares recent behaviour against a route, query or job's own
  # history to answer "what changed?" rather than only "what is slow?".
  #
  # The baseline is the traffic-weighted metric across `baseline_window` of day
  # summaries; `comparison_window` is the recent slice measured against it. The
  # two never overlap.
  # config.baseline_window   = 28.days
  # config.comparison_window = 1.day

  # Hourly summaries decide how precisely a change point can be placed. They are
  # pruned at this age because the 1-day view is otherwise the only thing that
  # reads them. Inside this window Rails Pulse can say a route slowed down at
  # 14:00; beyond it, the finest answer is the day. Raising this buys precision
  # at the cost of summary table growth.
  # config.hourly_summary_retention = 2.days

  # A change is reported as a regression only when it clears both the ratio and
  # the absolute floor for its unit. The ratio alone flags trivial millisecond
  # noise on fast endpoints; the floor alone flags slow endpoints that never
  # actually changed. min_samples keeps low-traffic subjects quiet.
  # config.regression_thresholds = {
  #   ratio:                1.5,   # 50% worse than baseline
  #   min_delta_ms:         50.0,  # ...and at least 50ms worse
  #   min_delta_rate:       1.0,   # ...or 1 percentage point, for error rates
  #   min_samples:          100,   # minimum observations on each side
