# FastMcp - Model Context Protocol for Rails
# This initializer sets up the MCP middleware in your Rails application.
#
# In Rails applications, you can use:
# - ActionTool::Base as an alias for FastMcp::Tool
# - ActionResource::Base as an alias for FastMcp::Resource
#
# All your tools should inherit from ApplicationTool which already uses ActionTool::Base,
# and all your resources should inherit from ApplicationResource which uses ActionResource::Base.

# Mount the MCP middleware in your Rails application
# You can customize the options below to fit your needs.
