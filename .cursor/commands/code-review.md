# Code Review

When reviewing code changes:

1. **Bugs & errors** — Logic errors, typos, incorrect assumptions, edge cases
2. **Bad practices** — Anti-patterns, security issues, maintainability concerns
3. **Lost functionality** — Features or behavior removed without replacement
4. **Regressions** — Breaking changes to existing behavior or integrations

**Output:**
- Report findings in chat for few or minor issues
- Create an `.md` file (e.g. in `docs/`) with findings when there are many or significant issues
