Quepid makes improving your app's search results a repeatable, reliable engineering process that the whole team can understand. It deals with three issues:

1. **Our collaboration stinks** Making holistic progress on search requires deep, cross-functional collaboration. Shooting emails or tracking search requirements in spreadsheets won't cut it.

2. ***Search testing is hard*** Search changes are cross-cutting: most changes will cause problems. Testing is difficult: you can't run hundreds of searches after every relevance change.

3. **Iterations are slow** Moving forward seems impossible. To avoid sliding backwards, progress is slow. Many simply give up on search, depriving users of the means to find critical information.


**To learn more, please check out the [Quepid website](http://www.quepid.com) and the [Quepid wiki](http://github.com/o19s/quepid/wiki).**

**If you are ready to dive right in, you can use the [Hosted Quepid](http://app.quepid.com) service right now or follow the [installation steps](https://github.com/o19s/quepid/wiki/Installation-Guide) to set up your own instance of Quepid.**

# Development Setup

## I. System Dependencies

### Using Docker Compose

Provisioning from an already built machine takes approximately 3 - 4 minutes. Provisioning from scratch takes approximately 20 minutes.

#### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed Docker. Go here https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download for installation instructions. And the Docker app is launched.

To install using brew follow these steps:

```
brew cask install docker
brew cask install docker-toolbox
```

**NOTE:** you may get a warning about trusting Oracle on the first try. Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy, click the Allow Oracle button, and then try again to install docker-toolbox

#### 2. Setup your environment

Run the local Ruby based setup script to setup your Docker images:

```
bin/setup_docker
```

Optionally you can seed the database with sample data (the output will print out credentials you can use to login as various sample users):

```
bin/docker r bin/rake db:seed:sample_users
```

If you want to create some cases that have 100's and 1000's of queries, then do:

```
bin/docker r bin/rake db:seed:large_cases
```

This is useful for stress testing Quepid!  Especially the front end application!

#### 3. Running the app

Now fire up Quepid locally at http://localhost:3000:

```
bin/docker server
```

It can take up to a minute for the server to respond as it compiles all the front end assets on the first call.

We've created a helper script to run and manage the app through docker that wraps around the `docker-compose` command.  You will need Ruby installed.
You can still use `docker-compose` directly, but for the basic stuff you can use the following:

* Start the app: `bin/docker server` or `bin/docker s`
* Connect to the app container with bash: `bin/docker bash` or `bin/docker ba`
* Connect to the Rails console: `bin/docker console` or `bin/docker c`
* Run any command: `bin/docker run [COMMAND]` or `bin/docker r [COMMAND]`
* Run dev mode as daemon: `bin/docker daemon` or `bin/docker q`
* Destroy the Docker env: `bin/docker destroy` or `bin/docker d`
* Run front end unit tests: `bin/docker r rails test:frontend`
* Run back end unit tests: `bin/docker r rails test`


## II. Development Log

While running the app under foreman, you'll only see a request log, for more detailed logging run the following:

```
bin/docker r tail -f -n 200 log/development.log
```

**Note:** To clear the logs to avoid them getting too big run: `bin/docker r cat /dev/null > log/development.log`

## III. Run Tests

There are three types of tests that you can run:

### Minitest

These tests run the tests from the Rails side (mainly API controllers, and models):

```
bin/docker r rails test
```

Run a single test file via:

```
bin/docker r rails test test/models/user_test.rb
```

Or even a single test in a test file by passing in the line number!

```
bin/docker r rails test test/models/user_test.rb:33
```

If you need to reset your test database setup then run:

```
bin/docker r bin/rake db:drop RAILS_ENV=test
bin/docker r bin/rake db:create RAILS_ENV=test
```

View the logs generated during testing set `config.log_level = :debug` in `test.rb`
and then tail the log file via:

```
bin/docker r tail -f -n 200 log/test.log
```

### JS Lint

To check the JS syntax:

```
bin/docker r rails test:jshint
```

### Karma

Runs tests for the Angular side. There are two modes for the karma tests:

* Single run: `bin/docker r rails karma:run`
* Continuous/watched run: `bin/docker r bin/rake karma:start`

**Note:** The karma tests require the assets to be precompiled, which adds a significant amount of time to the test run. If you are only making changes to the test/spec files, then it is recommended you run the tests in watch mode (`bin/rake karma:start`). The caveat is that any time you make a change to the app files, you will have to restart the process (or use the single run mode).

### Rubocop

To check the Ruby syntax:

```
bin/docker r bundle exec rubocop
```

Rubocop can often autocorrect many of the lint issues it runs into via `--auto-correct-all`:

```
bin/docker r bundle exec rubocop --auto-correct-all
```

If there is a new "Cop" as they call their rules that we don't like, you can add it to the `./rubocop.yml` file.

### All Tests

If you want to run all of the tests in one go (before you commit and push for example), just run these two commands:

```
bin/docker r rails test
bin/docker r rails test:frontend
```

For some reason we can't run both with one command, _though we should be able to!_.

### Performance Testing

If you want to create a LOT of queries for a user for testing, then run

```
bin/docker r bin/rake db:seed:large_cases
```

You will have two users, `quepid+100sOfQueries@o19s.com` and `quepid+1000sOfQueries@o19s.com` to test with.

## IV. Debugging

### Debugging Ruby

Debugging ruby usually depends on the situation, the simplest way is to print out the object to the STDOUT:

```ruby
puts object         # Prints out the .to_s method of the object
puts object.inspect # Inspects the object and prints it out (includes the attributes)
pp object           # Pretty Prints the inspected object (like .inspect but better)
```

In the Rails application you can use the logger for the output:

```ruby
Rails.logger object.inspect
```

If that's not enough and you want to run a debugger, the `byebug` gem is included for that. Add `byebug` wherever you want a breakpoint and then run the code.

Also, we have the `derailed` gem available which helps you understand memory issues.

```
bin/docker r bundle exec derailed bundle:mem
```

### Debugging JS

While running the application, you can debug the javascript using your favorite tool, the way you've always done it.

The javascript files will be concatenated into one file, using the rails asset pipeline.

You can turn that off by toggling the following flag in `config/environments/development.rb`:

```ruby
# config.assets.debug = true
config.assets.debug = false
```

to

```ruby
config.assets.debug = true
# config.assets.debug = false
```

Because there are too many Angular JS files in this application, and in `debug` mode Rails will try to load every file separately, that slows down the application, and becomes really annoying in development mode to wait for the scripts to load. Which is why it is turned off by default.

**PS:** Don't forget to restart the server when you change the config.

Also please note that the files `secure.js`, `application.js`, and `admin.js` are used to load all the
JavaScript and CSS dependencies via the Rails Asset pipeline.   If you are debugging Bootstrap, then
you will want individual files.  So replace `//= require sprockets` with `//= require bootstrap-sprockets`.

## Convenience Scripts

This application has two ways of running scripts: `rake` & `thor`.

Rake is great for simple tasks that depend on the application environment, and default tasks that come by default with Rails.

Whereas Thor is a more powerful tool for writing scripts that take in args much more nicely than Rake.

### Rake

To see what rake tasks are available run:

```
bin/docker r bin/rake -T
```

**Note**: the use of `bin/rake` makes sure that the version of `rake` that is running is the one locked to the app's `Gemfile.lock` (to avoid conflicts with other versions that might be installed on your system). This is equivalent of `bundle exec rake`.

Common rake tasks that you might use:

```
# db
bin/rake db:create
bin/rake db:drop
bin/rake db:migrate
bin/rake db:rollback
bin/rake db:schema:load
bin/rake db:seed
bin/rake db:setup

# show routes
bin/rake routes

# tests
bin/rake test
bin/rake test:js
bin/rake test:jshint
bin/rake test:quepid
```

### Thor

The see available tasks:

```
bin/docker r thor list
```

Examples include:

```
case
----
thor case:share CASEID TEAMID  # shares case with an team

ratings
-------
thor ratings:generate SOLRURL FILENAME  # generates random ratings into a .csv file
thor ratings:import CASEID FILENAME     # imports ratings to a case

user
----
thor user:create EMAIL USERNAME PASSWORD    # creates a new user
thor user:grant_administrator EMAIL         # grant administrator privileges to user
thor user:reset_password EMAIL NEWPASSWORD  # resets user's password
```

To see more details about any of the tasks, run `bin/docker r thor help TASKNAME`:

```
thor help user:create
Usage:
  thor user:create EMAIL USERNAME PASSWORD

Options:
  -a, [--administrator], [--no-administrator]  

Description:
  `user:create` creates a new user with the passed in email, name and password.

  EXAMPLES:

  $ thor user:create foo@example.com "Eric Pugh" mysuperstrongpassword

  With -a option, will mark the user as Administrator

  EXAMPLES:

  $ thor user:create -a admin@example.com Administrator mysuperstrongpassword
```

# Elasticsearch

You will need to configure Elasticsearch to accept requests from the browser using [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing). To enable CORS, add the following to elasticsearch's config file. Usually, this file is located near the elasticsearch executable at `config/elasticsearch.yml`.

```yml
http.cors:
  enabled: true
  allow-origin: /https?:\/\/localhost(:[0-9]+)?/
```

See more details on the wiki at https://github.com/o19s/quepid/wiki/Troubleshooting-Elasticsearch-and-Quepid

# Dev Errata

## I'd like to use a new Node module, or update a existing one

Typically you would simply do:

```
bin/docker r yarn add foobar
```

or

```
bin/docker r yarn upgrade foobar
```

which will install/upgrade the Node module, and then save that dependency to `package.json`.

Then check in the updated `package.json` and `yarn.lock` files.

## I'd like to use a new Ruby Gem, or update a existing one

Typically you would simply do:

```
bin/docker r bundle add foobar
```

which will install the new Gem, and then save that dependency to `Gemfile`.

You can also upgrade a gem via:

```
bin/docker r bundle update foobar
```

Then check in the updated `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` files.  For good measure
run the `bin/setup_docker`.


## I'd like to test SSL

There's a directory `.ssl` that contains they key and cert files used for SSL. This is a self signed generated certificate for use in development ONLY!

The key/cert were generated using the following command:

```
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -sha1 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout .ssl/localhost.key -out .ssl/localhost.crt
```

**PS:** It is not necessary to do that again.

What you need to do:

1. Drag `.ssl/localhost.crt` to `System` in `Keychain Access` (this is for OS X)
2. run (this is for Ubuntu/Docker):
  * `sudo cp .ssl/localhost.crt /etc/ssl/cert`
  * `sudo cp .ssl/localhost.key /etc/ssl/private`
  * `sudo c_rehash`
3. Add the Thin webserver for testing SSL, `bin/docker r bundle install thin`
4. In `Procfile.dev` comment the part that uses `puma` and uncomment the part that uses `thin`
5. In `.env` make sure you add `FORCE_SSL=true`
6. Restart the server
7. Go to `https://localhost:3000`
8. Undo your Thin changes afterwords!

**PS:** Why are we using both `puma` and `thin`? Because I simply could not figure out how to get `puma` to work properly with SSL and did not want to spend any more time on it!

## Modifying the database

Here is an example of generating a migration:
```
bin/docker r bundle exec bin/rails g migration FixCuratorVariablesTriesForeignKeyName
```

Followed by `bin/docker r bundle exec rake db:migrate`

## Updating RubyGems

Modify the file `Gemfile` and then run:

```
bin/docker r bundle install
```

You will see a updated `Gemfile.lock`, go ahead and check it and `Gemfile` into Git.


# QA

There is a code deployment pipeline to the http://quepid-staging.herokuapp.com site that
is run on successful commits to `master`.  

If you have pending migrations you will need to run them via:

```
heroku run bin/rake db:migrate -a quepid-staging
heroku restart -a quepid-staging
```

## Seed Data

The following accounts are created through the seeds. They all follow the following format:

```
email: quepid+[type]@o19s.com
password: password
```

where type is one of the following:

* `admin`: An admin account
* `1case`: A trial user with 1 case
* `2case`: A trial user with 2 cases
* `solr`: A trial user with a Solr case
* `es`: A trial user with a ES case
* `10sOfQueries`: A trial user with a Solr case that has 10s of queries
* `100sOfQueries`: A trial user with a Solr case that has 100s of queries (usually disabled)
* `1000sOfQueries`: A trial user with a Solr case that has 1000s of queries (usually disabled)
* `oscOwner`: A trial user who owns the team 'OSC'
* `oscMember`: A trial user who is a member of the team 'OSC'
* `CustomScorer`: A trial user who has a custom scorer
* `CustomScorerDefault`: A trial user who has a custom scorer that is set as their default
