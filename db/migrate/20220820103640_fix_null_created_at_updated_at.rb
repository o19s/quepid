class FixNullCreatedAtUpdatedAt < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  # This migration is really just meant for the production app.quepid.com database.
  # we built this app in Flask a million years ago, and when we moved to Rails, we
  # added the updated_at/created_at fields, but never went back and cleaned up the data.
  # looking at the ratings table,
  # Rating id 464585	has empty values:	0000-00-00 00:00:00	0000-00-00 00:00:00
  # Rating id 464589	has populated values	2016-12-15 16:22:42	2016-12-15 16:22:42
  # So, we are choosing 2016-12-14 0:00:00 as the new default time.
  # This is to prevent some old cases from puking, specifically around ratings.
